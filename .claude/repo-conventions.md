# Repo Conventions for Blog Posts

Last inspected: 2026-05-13
Re-inspect: monthly, or when new config files appear at repo root.

## How Agent-Written Posts Reach the Live Site

```
Agent writes blog/YYYY-MM-DD-slug.md
        ↓
Git push to main
        ↓
GitHub Actions: .github/workflows/sync-blog.yml
        ↓
scripts/sync-blog.ts  ← reads blog/*.md, upserts to Postgres
        ↓
blog_posts table (live DB)
        ↓
tRPC blogRouter.list / getBySlug
        ↓
BlogIndex.tsx / BlogPost.tsx (live site)
```

**Important:** Do NOT write posts to any other location.
Writing to `blog/` and pushing is the only path to publication.

---

## Blog Content Directory

`blog/` at the repo root.

---

## Filename Convention

```
YYYY-MM-DD-slug.md
```

Examples:
- `2026-05-13-someone-selling-knockoffs-amazon-california.md`
- `2026-05-14-what-is-a-demand-letter.md`

Rules:
- Date prefix is today's local date (YYYY-MM-DD).
- Slug is the focused search query in kebab-case.
- All lowercase, hyphens only, no underscores.
- Each filename must be globally unique (date prefix guarantees this).

---

## Frontmatter Schema

```yaml
---
title: "Specific, search-intent title here"
slug: specific-search-intent-title-here
description: "≤155 char meta description that includes the focused query."
excerpt: "2–3 sentence plain-English summary of the post (used as card teaser on /blog)."
date: YYYY-MM-DD
author: "Talk to My Lawyer Team"
category: intellectual-property
tags: ["cease and desist", "ecommerce", "trademark", "california"]
status: published
---
```

### Required fields
| Field | Notes |
|---|---|
| `title` | Full sentence, ≤300 chars |
| `slug` | Kebab-case, matches focused query, ≤300 chars |
| `description` | ≤155 chars — this becomes the `<meta name="description">` |
| `excerpt` | 2–3 sentences. If omitted, sync script auto-generates from body. |
| `date` | YYYY-MM-DD local date |
| `category` | **Must be one of the BLOG_CATEGORIES enum values (see below).** |
| `status` | `published` to go live. `draft` to hold. Default: `published`. |

### Optional fields
| Field | Notes |
|---|---|
| `author` | Defaults to `"Talk to My Lawyer Team"` |
| `tags` | Free-form array; used for internal tracking only, not displayed |

---

## BLOG_CATEGORIES Enum

The `category` field must be exactly one of these values:

| Value | Use for |
|---|---|
| `demand-letters` | Demand letters, unpaid invoices, money owed |
| `cease-and-desist` | C&D letters, stopping harmful behavior |
| `contract-disputes` | Breach of contract, contractor disputes |
| `eviction-notices` | Eviction, unlawful detainer |
| `employment-disputes` | Wrongful termination, unpaid wages, harassment |
| `consumer-complaints` | Refunds, deposits, consumer rights |
| `pre-litigation-settlement` | Pre-suit negotiation, settlement letters |
| `debt-collection` | Debt collection rights, FDCPA |
| `estate-probate` | Estate disputes, probate |
| `landlord-tenant` | Rent, security deposits, habitability |
| `insurance-disputes` | Insurance claim denials |
| `personal-injury` | Personal injury demand letters |
| `intellectual-property` | Trademark, copyright, counterfeit, DMCA, ecommerce IP |
| `family-law` | Divorce, custody, support |
| `neighbor-hoa` | HOA disputes, neighbor issues |
| `document-analysis` | Document review tool content |
| `pricing-and-roi` | Cost comparisons, flat-fee vs. hourly |
| `general` | Catch-all; avoid if a more specific category fits |

**Weekday theme → category guidance:**
- Mon (landlord/tenant) → `landlord-tenant` or `eviction-notices`
- Tue (contractor/construction) → `contract-disputes`
- Wed (ecommerce/IP) → `intellectual-property`
- Thu (freelancer/unpaid invoices) → `demand-letters`
- Fri (consumer) → `consumer-complaints`
- Sat (letter deep dives) → match to specific letter type category
- Sun (comparison/process) → `pricing-and-roi` or `general`

---

## Heading Style

- H1 at top of body (matches or closely mirrors the title)
- H2 for major sections (rendered as `text-2xl font-bold` in BlogPost.tsx)
- H3 for sub-sections
- Bold (`**text**`) for inline emphasis
- No raw HTML in content — the server `renderMarkdown` function handles conversion

---

## Internal Link Convention

Link to prior posts using the slug path:
```markdown
[cease and desist letters](/blog/new-02-cease-and-desist-letters-explained)
```
or, for new-format files:
```markdown
[demand letters](/blog/2026-05-13-what-is-a-demand-letter)
```

## AI Citation Optimisation (new — 2026-05-13)

Structure every post so AI agents (ChatGPT, Perplexity, Claude) can extract
and cite it easily:

1. **Direct answer in the first 100 words** — answer the search query before
   explaining context. The sync script uses these opening paragraphs as the
   `excerpt`.

2. **Short Answer paragraph** — start the body with a 2–3 sentence plain-English
   answer. The `BlogPost.tsx` renderer surfaces this as a styled callout when
   the first paragraph is ≤300 chars.

3. **H2 sections as discrete questions** — phrase H2s as questions or clear
   topics so the JSON-LD FAQ schema (injected by `BlogPost.tsx`) can lift them
   into structured data.

4. **Disclaimer always last** — the `*This article is general information...*`
   line must appear at the very end, not in the middle of content.

---

## Sync Script Reference

```bash
# Sync all blog/ markdown to the live database
DATABASE_URL=... pnpm tsx scripts/sync-blog.ts

# Triggered automatically in CI on every push that touches blog/*.md
# See .github/workflows/sync-blog.yml
```

The sync script:
- Upserts by `slug` (insert on conflict → update)
- Auto-generates `excerpt` from body if not in frontmatter
- Auto-calculates `readingTimeMinutes` (word count ÷ 200)
- Maps `tags` → `category` if explicit `category` field is absent
- Sets `publishedAt` to the frontmatter `date` for published posts

---

## State Files (inside repo)

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `.claude/repo-conventions.md` | This file. Agent reads at the start of every run. |
| `.claude/published-topics.md` | Running log of published titles by date. Agent checks this to avoid duplicates. |

---

## Citation Feedback Loop (new — 2026-05-13)

Before writing any post, read `.claude/citation-scores.md`.

This file is updated every Sunday night by GitHub Actions (`citation-audit.yml`).
It tells you:

- Which queries TTML is currently being cited for by Perplexity and other AI engines
- Which queries we're losing (content gaps → write these next)
- Which competitor domains are winning the queries we're losing
- Which post structures and buckets have the highest citation rates

**Decision rules:**
- If a query appears in "Content Gaps" and no post exists → write it this week
- If a post exists but isn't being cited → update it: sharpen the opening paragraph, add more H2 questions, add California statute citations
- If a bucket has citation rate >60% → write a deeper post in that bucket
- If a bucket has citation rate 0% → hold off; the posts may be too new (2–6 week citation lag)

The citation rate is the KPI. Not pageviews. Not rankings. Whether AI engines cite us when someone asks our target questions.
